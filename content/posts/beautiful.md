All music is beautiful, right?  Whatever your jam, and there are many varieties of jam, you probably have some artist, song or even a jingle that just gets you moving.  Cool right?

The one music that is designed to not get you moving is `Beautiful Music`.  

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_music)

> Beautiful music initially offered soft and unobtrusive instrumental selections on a very structured schedule with limited commercial interruptions.

Blech! They literally had to figure out ways to play weeks of music on reel to reel tapes without repetition, because you'd notice something that's almost subconciously putting you to sleep is actually going to wake you up, going, "Whuh?"

And yet, and yet --- this is the core of Christmas Holiday music.  The same songs, perhaps sung by different artists, but generally the same songs, played over, and over and over.  And why do we notice?  Because that can't happen in the same day.
