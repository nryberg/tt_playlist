Christmas Music rocks. Sort of.

Every year, around November, radio stations of a particular type across the country start shifting their content from a mix of nostalgia rock to a unique stew of tracks for the holidays. Yes, we're talking about Christmas Music.   

In a world increasingly aware of its diversity, this unabashedly Christian-focused (it's in the name, folks) is breathtakingly out of date. Unfortunately, this places it in the particular category of sweetly nostalgic (think of shopping in malls in the 1970s if you're that age) and highly vulnerable to criticism and humor.  

On this site, we're going to take the Reindeer by the horns, and both celebrate and, in many cases, mock the unusual world that is the Christmas Song playlist on the oldies radio stations. 

## Diversity

How unusual is it? Compared to a hits station with a very tight playlist focused on the here and now, it's on point. However, it's repetitive for the oldies stations recycling decades of music, or a genuinely unfair comparison, a diversity-focused station like [The Current].  

Usually, diversity means multiple cultures or skin colors - while the cultural tone is as annoying as a car horn, many artists who have found success either at release or in the modern day are more reflective of America's broader community. At least the community that America thought it had back in the 1950s to 1960s.

## Time 

Something you'll notice about the oldies stations - they have a hard stop of about 30 years ago. While it's part of licensing terms (much cheaper to play Pink Floyd from decades ago than Ed Sheeran from yesterday), it's also psychological.  

For many folks, 30-40 years ago invokes sweet memories. Conveniently forgetting their past and America's early steps in a long journey of progress, it's fun to think back about that Ford LTD you rode in, you know, the yellow one. You got to go to Dairy Queen, the park and the movies! So much fun! In many healthy ways, we've let go of the darker side of childhood, leaving us with a charming, if slightly sickly sweet, set of memories of what it was to be alive back then. If you were lucky enough to have a relatively average family of middle-class means, you didn't go to bed hungry, and your parents loved you. Probably drove you crazy in your teen years, but they loved you. 

What can snap you back to a pleasant memory? A song you heard on the radio at that time. Even if you **hated** that song with a white-hot passion, now it's an "awwww" moment.  

## Repetition

Repetition makes the heart grow fonder until it drives you nuts.

That's the charm and the horror of Christmas Music - it's the same songs, over and over and over. 

In the heyday of Jazz, it was considered normal to remake other artists' songs. Country music still celebrates the remake, but the rash of singers taken to court on wild claims of plagiarism dampens the enthusiasm. Besides, what modern artist wants to be known for repeatedly remaking other people's songs? Buble, I'm looking at you.

You think to yourself by mid-December, "Oh, I've heard `Sleigh Ride` 8,000 times," because, yes, you've probably heard this icon many times by many different artists. But, in this case, nine artists took a whack at it, with just a few dominating the charts.

A few songs are single artists - they're so iconic that it's rare that few artists dare to take them on - "Feliz Navidad" and "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch ."I adore the second and loathe the first.
