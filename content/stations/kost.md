One of the oldest stations, born in 1957 as KGLA, and broacasts from the top of [Mount Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_(California)) in the San Gabriel mountains.  Mount Wilson is relatively hard to identify, if it weren't for all of the radio and television antennas.

In 1968 they adopted the unusual "all music" format - given that licensing back then required at least some regular news broadcasting.  KOST is prounounced in a stage whisper "coast".  Get it?  Los Angeles?  Beaches?  Anyway.

In 1968 they adopted beautiful music and then slowly transitioned to adult contemporary in the early '80's.  Later in the 2000's they transitioned to upbeat adult contemporary.  Of all the stations, this has probably the longest tenure and the least change.
