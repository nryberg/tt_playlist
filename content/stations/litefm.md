## History

Born WRVR in 1961, it was owned by a church in New York, playing classical music, a little jazz and some religious programming.  After being sold in the 1970s, it developed the beginnings of "smooth jazz.  1980 saw call letter changes and the flip to country music. In 1984 it started with easy listening but still avoided the worst of the elevator music songs.  Like Billy Joel, which it played, it wouldn't play any brand new music.  Nowadays it's a upbeat variety rock station.

To this day, it still plays a 5:00 AM broadcast from its first owner - Riverside Church.
