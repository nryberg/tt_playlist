## History

Born KTWN in 1968, it changed call signs, formats, owners many time throughout the decades.  Starting in 1988, it officially switched to the oldies format, starting with the 1950s and 1960s.  

It shifted formats as the years moved on, slowly dropping the older decades and pulling in the later decades.
