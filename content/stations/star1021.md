## History

Born KJIM in 1962, it changed call signs, formats, owners many time throughout the decades.  

- Classic Rock
- Beautiful Rock
- Alternative
- Soft Adult Contemporary

Then finally, starting in 2016, it officially switched to the mainstream adult contemporary format.  

In the 1990's it created annual editions of local Dallas/Ft. Worth bands on compilation CD's, for only $2.94.  Hosting an annual "Edgefest" music festival saw acts the like of Pearl Jam, My Chemical Romance, INXS and Beck.  

Briefly in 1994, it was owned by the Mormons, and then sold to Clear Channel Radio.  That was the beginning of the "end as they knew it" for a very cutting edge station.
