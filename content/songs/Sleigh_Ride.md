`Sleigh Ride` is _the_ quintessential Chistmas Song.  It's fun, upbeat, and you can jingle your car keys to it in this blatantly overdubbed "live" [show](https://youtu.be/sSazgH6CT7o) with Amy Grant. 

The Ronnettes kill it with plays and managing to cram a live, slightly terrified horse into a recording studio.  It's sweet, has great chord changes, and keeps those toes a tapping.

Johnny Mathis clips along at a slightly faster pace, and really hits those giddyups hard:
